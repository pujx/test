							<p>Please read the terms and conditions of this Agreement carefully before continuing with the use of the AutoTrade service. If you continue to browse and use this website you are agreeing to comply with and be bound by the following terms and conditions of use, which together with our privacy policy govern AutoTrade's relationship with you in relation to this website.
								<br />Each time you use the website, the current version of the Terms and Conditions will apply.
							</p>
							<p>AutoTrade is an automated platform to copy trades from one account to another based on the client's settings.</p>
							<p>The term AutoTrade or "us" or "we" refers to the owner of the website. The term "you", "client" refers to the user or viewer of our website.
								<br />The use of this website is subject to the following terms of use:
							</p>
							<p>The section headings contained in this agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of this agreement.</p>
							<p><b>1. Risk Of Loss</b>
								<br /> (a) All performance claims found on AutoTrade about trading systems or strategies must be regarded as hypothetical. Use of AutoTrade to offer or subscribe to a trading system or strategy indicates you agree to our Terms and Conditions. Before using any systems or strategies listed on AutoTrade you should be aware that there is often a vast difference between hypothetical results and real-life trading results achievable in a real brokerage account, and real-live results are almost always vastly worse than hypothetical results. Performance results for systems and strategies listed on AutoTrade do not take into account fees, spreads and/or trading commissions that may be charged by your broker. Please consult with your broker for information on these costs. Additional information on how AutoTrade calculates performance data can be found on the AutoTrade Help page.
							</p>
							<p>(b) HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS HAVE MANY INHERENT LIMITATIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. NO REPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE THAT ANY ACCOUNT WILL OR IS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE PROFITS OR LOSSES SIMILAR TO THOSE SHOWN. IN FACT, THERE ARE FREQUENTLY SHARP DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND THE ACTUAL RESULTS SUBSEQUENTLY ACHIEVED BY ANY PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM. ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS IS THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PREPARED WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT. IN ADDITION, HYPOTHETICAL TRADING DOES NOT INVOLVE FINANCIAL RISK, AND NO HYPOTHETICAL TRADING RECORD CAN COMPLETELY ACCOUNT FOR THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL RISK IN ACTUAL TRADING. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ABILITY TO WITHSTAND LOSSES OR ADHERE TO A PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM IN SPITE OF TRADING LOSSES ARE MATERIAL POINTS WHICH CAN ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER FACTORS RELATED TO THE MARKETS IN GENERAL OR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY SPECIFIC TRADING PROGRAM WHICH CANNOT BE FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PREPARATION OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND ALL OF WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS.</p>
